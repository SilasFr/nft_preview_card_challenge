## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The HTML in this project is very simple. But I did learn how to bend the CSS properties to my will. The 'transition' property is key in this project and it gives a totally different feeling to the user.

Also I learned how to render an image sometimes as background-image or sometimes as an <img> tag. Dependin on what you want to do with it, it may be easier to have it one way or another.

### Continued development

I plan on getting my CSS skills to a higher level. I see that my peers have a hard time using CSS but it is actually amazing what you can do just with HTML and CSS!

### Useful resources

- [Live-Server] - This helped me work a lot faster, and see changes in real time.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website that teaches a lot about web development.
